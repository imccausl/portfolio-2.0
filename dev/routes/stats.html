      <h3>Oh, hello...</h3>
      <p>Let me introduce myself...</p>
      <p>In April of 2016 I left my PhD program and returned to coding after a 15-year hiatus.</p>
      <p>My Humanities PhD research was getting more technical. I moved from research into the history of Psychology and Psychoanalysis
        to Information Theory and Cybernetics and started working on an idea about the relationship between hardware and
        software, circuits and instruction sets, and how it pertains to the popular understanding of the human mind as a
        computer, a metaphor that shapes the discourse of cognitive psychology.</p>
      <p>I left academia with a renewed excitement and engagement with computing, one that I had originally discovered as a
        teenager working with BASIC, VisualBASIC, C, and making games with HyperCard's HyperTalk scripting language. I already
        knew amazing things were happening in web development: the impending death of Flash, ushered in with the iPhone,
        and becoming almost inevitable with the release of the iPad in 2010, kick-started a renaissance of application development
        for the web, which was fast becoming a platform in-and-of itself. I knew immediately that I was going to direct my
        focus on web development.</p>
