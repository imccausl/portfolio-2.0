          <p>I love trying to understand how things work. In fact, I built this site entirely with vanilla JavaScript
          instead of using any of the abundance of libraries that would have expedited the process of creating 
          routers because I wanted to understand what goes into the creation of routing libraries. A lot of my
          practice projects are like that, too. I want to understand the fundamentals before I reap the benefits of 
          the magic.</p>
          <p>Before I threw myself into coding, I had aspirations of becoming an academic. I completed a Master's degree
          and was six years into a PhD (admittedly, 4 of those years I was floundering because I knew I didn't want
          to devote myself to academia anymore, but I didn't know how to change the course that I had set myself
          to for so long). Strangely enough, during this period, my research became more-and-more centered around
          understanding the transmission and reception of information: in particular, how a string of bytes can come 
          to be translated into something intelligable for human beings.</p>
          <p>My interest in coding actually began much earlier, but since I've returned to the fray, I have
            discovered that my graduate education has equiped me with the kinds of skills that are important
            for a programmer: problem solving, critical thinking, and research. In the past year, I've used my
            research and analytic skills to learn AWS, Node, and the fundamentals of programming. I was never very
            interested in simply learning JavaScript, but rather in learning to think computationally, a skill, 
            of course, much better suited to programming than simply knowing one language or another.</p>
