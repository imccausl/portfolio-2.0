      <h3>Oh, hello...</h3>
      <h5>Let me introduce myself...</h5>
      <p>I am a web developer specializing in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I mainly use (Ubuntu) Linux and macOS for web development,
        with Windows 10 thrown in mainly for testing browser compatibility and seeing how the Windows Subsystem for Linux
        is shaping up. I am an avid user of Node and know my way around its various tools, especially: Npm, Yarn, Webpack,
        Gulp, ESLint, Prettier, and Babel.
      </p>
      <p>My main preoccupation right now is not only learning as much as possible about JavaScript, but using JavaScript to
        practice more fundamental programming concepts such as
        <strong>functional programming</strong>, principles of Object Orientation,
        <strong>design patterns</strong>, including, but not limited to,
        <strong>MVC</strong>. To this end, I alternate between working with frameworks (especially, right now, React, but I am also
        familiar with Angular and Ember) and vanilla JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>In fact, this very site is created almost entirely with vanilla JavaScript, although I use a little bit of jQuery for
        the Ajax calls that control its routes in order to piggyback on the robustness of the jQueryâ€™s Ajax implementation.
        Independent modules control specific functions such as the collapsable navigation menu, tooltips, routing, displaying
        projects, and my 'currently reading' and 'coding time' widgets on the about page. I use Babel and Webpack in order
        to take advantage of ES6 language features and modules and Gulp to automate the build process.
      </p>
      <p>I have a BA in English and an MA in Social Theory and Cultural Criticism. During my graduate studies, I worked as a
        researcher and teaching assistant studying how popular culture and mass media create and disseminate meaning.
      </p>
      <p>My education has furnished me with the kind of thinking necessary for bridging the gap between the humanities and technology
        and is an extension of my passion for creating compelling and solid user experiences. I thoroughly enjoy thinking
        about and understanding complex subjects and putting this thinking to work in creating meaningful and accessible
        user experiences for all.
      </p>
      <p>At the moment, I work full-time at job unrelated to web development, and work 30-40 hours per week on top of that sharpening
        my web development skills; so I'm no stranger to hard work, determination and drive.
      </p>
